# Assignment 1: Space Minesweeper

Please follow the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/CSCI-4611-Spring-2024/Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-1/README.md) to finish setting up your repository and start working with this code.

You should fill out the following information before submission:

1. **Third Party Assets**. List the name and source of any third party assets that you added, such as models, images, sounds, or any other content used that was not solely written by you. 

   I used a friend's voice with FULL permission and consent.

2. **Wizard Bonus Functionality**. If you completed the wizard bonus challenge, then please provide a brief description along with any instructions for the person grading your assignment.

   Hello, to start the game, you just click (Sadly, I don't know why one of my assets at the beginning of the game shows up as a black box, it isn't supposed to be that.), and once you've entered, you can just die and see the ending or you can hit 10+ mice and get a sick skin by pressing left click + shift, you can change back using left click + shift again. Also added is a part where the mice aka "mines" are looking at the cat to make it more natural.
